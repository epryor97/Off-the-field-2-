    <h5><center>COACHING OUTSIDE THE BOUNDS<h5></center>
  <p><center>It is easier to blame the underage victims by convincing outselves that coaches don't exploit their atheltes but it's time to start beleiving and supporting the victims.
      <p> Holding the perpetrators accountable starts with being educated and looking to the danger signs.
  <p><center>**The coaches cannot gain access to children without a strongly built social community around them.** 
      <div>
  <p>This allows the perp' to groom and manipulate the trust of the other parents so that they can abuse the child and "get away with it."

  <p><center> Parents, listen up! These are signs, advice and behaviors to look out for that YOU need to think about :
      <hr>
      <p>The coach has your child added as a friend on snapchat, instagram, facebook, ect.
          
      <p><center>You would sum up as the coach as 'too friendly', but "they're 'harmless."
          
      <p><center>You notice that the coach is routinely playing games or making bets with your child.
          
      <p><center> The coach makes comments about your childs body looking "good" in this sports equipment or this sports outfit.
          
      <p><center>The coach wanting to drive your children places without you (pick them up, take them to practice.)
          
      <p><center> The coach wants private lessons, specifically, without you being there.
          
      <p><center> The coach wants a lot of alone time with you, the parents (gives you, the parent reassurance they would "never be capable of doing such horrible acts.)
          
      <p><center>TRUST YOUR GUTS PARENTS. Anything that sends your radar off, pay attention to it!!!!</p><center>
          
      <p><center> Your kids telling you that their coach is their friend.
          
      <p><center>***Coaches that WANT to hangout/spend time outside of practice hours with teenagers/underage athletes.***
      <p><center>****Watch for tight niched relationships/ social dynmaics between coaches and parents/the community. 
      <p> The coaches are grooming parents around them to make themselves look like the "good guy" so that IF they get cuaght, they need people to beleive they are good people. ****
          
      <p>Coaches wanting to attend your childs other sports events; if theyre involved.
          
      <p><center> Coach drinks heavily with parents. 
          
      <p><center>Gift giving.
          
      <p><center> Everyone knows he/she(the coach) can be innapropriate but they are just "immature."
          
      <p><center> You start noticing that there is always one family that seems to always have coach at their house on the weekends and have him/her around; during non-practice hours. 
          <p>(The abuser is getting close to one family so they have their protection once they abuse another child. Since he/she is not abusing their child, they will not beleive the vctim since he "didnt touch their child so he couldnt have possibly done it."
          
    <li><center> **The coach never goes on dates, has a social life or has friends, but is very close to atheltes and parents** 
        <p><center> Coach inquires about sexual life/ takes an interest if you have dated anybody/kissed anybody/done anything sexual/asked how far you have gone.)

        <p><center> The perp grooms the community as much as they groom the child. 
        <p><center>They often take on the overly friendly "hero" role that is dramatic and charasmatic. Overtime, they are shaping an "innocent" personality and maniplating their true intentions.
            
        <p><center>There are ways to put a protective barrier between you and a child molestor and I will tell you how:
            
           
  <h3><p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#FF0000; padding: 1em;">What can you do parents? </h3></p>
  <h6></h6>
  <p><center>Attend as many workouts, practices, sprots events as possible.</p>
  <p><center>Be an active parent in your childs sport. Ask them a lot of questions when they come home.</p>
  <p><center> Abusers often tagret children with absent parents. The perps take on the role of the "caregiver" to make the child feel special and cared for.
  <p><center>Attend private lessons.
  <p><center>Dont let your child be alone in the car with the coach.
  <p><center>Listen to what your child says about what the coach says and how they act at practice. Ask your child as many questions as you can.
   <p><center> Tell them about consent. Verbally, sexually and about boundaries.
   <p><center> ****MAKE IT CLEAR TO THE COACH WHAT PERMISSIONS YOU ALLOW FOR HAND SPOTTING****
  <p><center> Teach your child correct genitlia words.
  <p><center> Go through your childs personal things. A lot of victims write what is happening to them.

 <h2><p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#000000; padding: 1em;"> BEHAVIOR YOUR CHILD MIGHT EXIBIT IF THEY ARE BEING ABUSED: BE ON THE LOOKOUT:<p><h2></h2></
    
   <p><center>Taking an unsual amount of showers(victims feel gross and dirty.)
   <p><center> Acting out so they dont have to go to practice.
   <p><center>Your child starts lying to you about little things, that they never lied about(perp is teaching them to lie and they are "practicing keeping secrets."
   <p><center>Your child is taking long in the bathroom or sneaking around with their phone (sexting.)
   <p><center>If your child talks about their private parts.
   <p><center> You see a drastic change in your child. Anger, sadness, frustration, anxiety.
   <p><center> Your childs grades are slacking-so they dont have to go to practice.
   <p><center>Eating Disorder behavior. 
 <p><center>Your child is not themself and you have ruled out school, friendships, and anything else.
  <p><center>Your child is being given gifts. 
    <p><center> Your childs language changes. The perpetrator often makes them feel special and mature to make them they are mature enough to consent.  
   <p><center>Your child becomes upset or distraught when undressing/shopping for clothes.
  <p><center>Your child will behave in different ways and you know your child better than anyone else so be alert if you notice some of these changes in behavior. 
  <p><center> "Coach" kept me late" becomes a routine thing and just your child when coach didnt keep everyone late.
  <p> Your child devlops an "out of the blue" preocupation with their body.
